# Alphabeta-Invoicing-Analysis

#### Using the dataset provided, I developed insightful visualizations and calculated various measures in Power BI to address key business questions effectively.

#### Some of the measures I created include:

#### Revenue Last Month – Calculating sales revenue for the previous month.
#### Revenue Last Year – Analyzing revenue performance from the same period in the prior year.
#### Total Revenue – Summing up all sales transactions for a comprehensive overview.
#### Sales Count – Counting the total number of sales made.
#### Year-to-Year Sales Percentage – Comparing sales performance across years.
#### Day-to-Day Sales Percentage – Measuring daily sales trends.
#### Month-to-Month Sales Percentage – Tracking monthly growth or decline in sales.
#### Creation of a Date Table – Designing a dynamic date table to support time-based calculations and analysis.
#### Additionally, I incorporated an interactive toggle button into the visualization. This feature allows users to seamlessly switch between chart and table views, enhancing 
    user engagement and flexibility in data exploration.
